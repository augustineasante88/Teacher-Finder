# Student Teacher Finder

The idea behind this app was to build a platform where students can find and book appointment with fellow students to teach them. This was built with laravel and it was made with love by ME.
It has 3 roles i.e Supa Admin, Students, and A teacher.

- The Supa Admin coordinates everything on the system and resolve dispute etc and approves students request to be a teacher on the platform.
